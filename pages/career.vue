            This work took place in participation to a collaborative national effort in the frame of ROMMA project.<br/>
            The
            project as such aimed to automate the process of preparation of the digital mock-up; that is the geometric
            representation of a product, in order to meet simulation process requirements. In the context of my
            research, a
            method to automatically identify components functional properties, and to restructure their geometry
            according
            to this functional knowledge, was proposed and implemented. This implementation provided semantic
            annotations
            that are necessary for the finite-element-analysis preparation phase. The method validity was against
            real-life
            data provided by industrial partner.

            Participated in delivering a variety of projects, I worked on deploying the new information system of Points
            Of
            Sales and Service (POSS). After the project has been successfully launched in April 2007, efforts were paid
            to
            customize this Web application. Once the new system was largely stabilized and adapted to the company’s
            needs, a
            new project was initiated and baptized Vanman. It was meant to address overlooked issues in original POSS,
            particularly wholesales management. The initial version of the system was put to operation within less than
            three months, many changes has been made to this module later on, in accordance to users' feedback and
            continuously emerging requirements. Vanman -involving many technologies, such as mobile systems development,
            XML
            back-end, client-server model communication- was then one of the core business software that integrates with
            Mabco’s information system. Along the journey with Mabco many other minor projects have been initiated and
            successfully delivered.
