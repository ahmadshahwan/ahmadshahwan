          As part of my PhD, I developed an algorithm for extracting functional information from a 3D model.
          I participated in conferences in France and abroad, and made scientific publications as first and second author, in national and international journals.

          <p>The work was conducted as part of a collaborative national effort in the frame of ROMMA project.</p>
          <p>
            The project aimed to automate the process of preparation of the digital mock-up;
            that is the geometric representation of a product, in order to meet simulation process requirements. In the
            context of my research, a method to automatically identify components functional properties, and to
            restructure their geometry according to this functional knowledge, was proposed and implemented. This
            implementation provided semantic annotations that are necessary for the finite-element-analysis preparation
            phase. The method validity was against real-life data provided by industrial partner.

          After the project has been successfully launched in
          April 2007, focus was shifted to customize POSS. Once the new system was largely stabilized
          and adapted to the company's needs, a new project was initiated and baptized Vanman. It was meant to address
          overlooked issues in original POSS, particularly wholesales management. The initial version of the system was
          put to operation within less than three months, many changes has been made to this module later on, in
          accordance to users' feedback and continuously emerging requirements. Vanman -involving many technologies,
          such as mobile systems development, XML back-end, client-server model communication- was then one of the core
          business software that integrates with Mabco's information system. Along the journey with Mabco many other
          minor projects have been initiated and successfully delivered.
